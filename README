-- Burp Suite Extended --

Thanks for looking into our burp extension framework. 



--INSTALL--

To get this working you'll need to have your burp suite jar inside of this directory.

You'll then launch burp via the batch or sh file, please make sure that your burp jar is named correctly for the files...
by default it should just be named 'burp.jar'

That's all you really need to get the framework up and running.

--DEVELOPMENT--

So you want to develop your own Burp Extension? Great! 

Your Extension will be written in Python and stored in the Lib/extensions/ directory.
For any GUI related features you will be using Jython.
There are two example skeletons and other extensions that you can look at to get an idea of how to communicate with the framework.
We'll also try making multiple blog posts explaining how to create extensions and using the framework.


--SUPPORT--

We will be using PortSwiggers forums for any releases, updates, requests, input, communication...
